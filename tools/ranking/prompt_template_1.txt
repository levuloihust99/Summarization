Your job is to evaluate quality of several summaries for an article (written in Vietnamese), then give a ranking for these summaries. You are provided with several criteria for judging those summaries, each criterion has an importance level. The higher the level is, the more that you should focus on that criteria. The criteria you base on to judge the quality of a summary are:
1. The conciseness of the summary [importance level = 15]: if an entity (date, time, person, organization, location, etc.) appears in the summary, it must appear in the original article.
2. The coverage level [importance level = 10]: the information contained in the summary should be as much as possible of those which are mentioned in the original article. Furthermore, when there is length constraint (which is specified later), the information that is ignored in the summary should be less important than the information that is retained in the summary.
3. Length constraint [importance level = 10]: the summary should be as brief as possible. It must not exceed 3 sentences or 100 words. It must be at least as twice as brief as the article.
4. Duplication level [importance level = 10]: the summary should not contain any duplication, both lexically and semantically.
5. Fluency and coherence [importance level = 10]: the summary should be fluent and coherent. It should not contain non-logical sentences, weird words or something that does not make sense.
6. Spelling correctness and integrity [importance level = 8]: There shouldn't exist any spelling mistakes or sentence corruption, e.g. a sentence that has not been completed yet or has words that does not appear in the Vietnamese vocabulary.
7. Correctness in unicode [importance level = 5]: there shouldn't be any unicode error, e.g. a non-decodable symbol that renders as question mark.
Each summary has an attached ID. You should give the ranking as a list of IDs. E.g. Suppose we have three summaries whose IDs are 111, 222, 333 respectively. After evaluating these summaries, you conclude that summary 222 is better than summary 333, which in turn is better than summary 111. Then, you should reply in the format: 'Ranking: [222, 333, 111]'.
Here is the article and the summaries you want to rank:

Your task involves assessing the quality of multiple summaries derived from an article written in Vietnamese. For this, certain evaluation criteria will be provided to you, with each stipulating a maximum achievable score. You are expected to assign scores for each criterion, ensuring that the score for any given criterion does not exceed its maximum value nor fall below zero. A summary's final score will be the aggregate of its scores across all criteria. The criteria and their specific details are as follows:

1. Unicode Accuracy (Maximum score: 5) – Ensure that the summary is free of Unicode errors, such as indecipherable symbols that show up as question marks. A summary void of Unicode errors is awarded the full score, whereas each error leads to a 1-point deduction.

2. Spelling and Integrity (Maximum score: 8) – There should be no spelling errors or incomplete sentences. Misspelled words will result in a 1-point deduction each, while incomplete sentences will cost 3 points each.

3. Fluency and Coherence (Maximum score: 10) – The summary should be smoothly written and logically structured without containing any odd phrases or incoherent statements. Repetitive content, whether lexical or semantic, should be avoided. A well-written summary receives the full score. Instances of incoherence or duplication lead to a 2-point reduction each.

4. Length (Maximum score: 10) – The summary should be concise, not surpassing 3 sentences or 100 words, and at least half the length of the article. A summary meeting these conditions receives the full score. Going beyond these limits will incur a 2-point penalty per additional sentence.

5. Coverage (Maximum score: 10) – Evaluate the extent to which the summary encapsulates the information from the original article. Greater coverage equates to a higher score.

6. Conciseness (Maximum score: 15) – Assess whether every entity (such as dates, people, organizations, locations, etc.) present in the summary also exists in the original article. Incorrect entities will result in a 3-point deduction from the maximum score per entity.

When ranking the summaries, please list them in order of quality based on their attached IDs, with the highest quality summary first. For example, if you judge that summary with ID 222 is superior to 333, and 333 is better than 111, your response should be formatted as: 'Ranking: [222, 333, 111]'. Additionally, provide a detailed explanation for each summary's ranking, including the individual scores per criterion and the rationale behind them.
